# Travio – Development Phases Roadmap

## Phase 1: Requirement Analysis

### Objective
Clearly define the scope, target audience, and key features.

### Activities
- Stakeholder interviews to gather expectations and priorities
- Competitor analysis: study travel apps, social platforms, and booking services
- Define functional requirements: trip creation, matching, AI recommendations, SOS features
- Define non-functional requirements: scalability, security, performance, GDPR & privacy compliance
- Identify platform integrations: Google Maps, booking APIs, AI/ML modules
- Prepare Product Requirements Document (PRD) with detailed feature descriptions, user personas, and user stories

### Deliverables
- Functional & non-functional requirements
- User personas & journey maps
- PRD with detailed scope and feature list

---

## Phase 2: Design

### Objective
Establish the app's visual language, style, and UX principles.

### Activities
- Define brand identity: color palette, typography, logo, and icons
- Establish app layout principles for mobile-first and responsive design
- Create style guide & component library for consistent UI elements
- Define interaction patterns: swipes, lists, cards, maps, modals, chat flows

### Deliverables
- Branding guidelines & style guide
- UX principles & interaction patterns document

---

## Phase 3: Design Wireframes / Mockups

### Objective
Create the first low-fidelity design to visualize screens and flows.

### Activities
- Map out key screens: Landing, Signup, Profile, Dashboard, My Trips, Explore Trips, Nearby Essentials, Community
- Sketch user flows for onboarding, trip creation, matching, and emergency SOS
- Low-fidelity wireframes focusing on layout, navigation, and hierarchy
- Iterative feedback sessions with stakeholders

### Deliverables
- Low-fidelity wireframes for all major screens
- Annotated user flow diagrams

---

## Phase 4: Design Figma / High-Fidelity Mockups

### Objective
Convert wireframes into interactive, high-fidelity designs.

### Activities
- Design high-fidelity screens in Figma or similar design tools
- Apply branding, typography, colors, and UI components
- Include visual cues for AI features, SOS alerts, maps, and sponsored content
- Create clickable prototypes for user testing and navigation feedback
- Incorporate responsive/mobile and desktop variations

### Deliverables
- High-fidelity mockups for all screens
- Clickable prototype ready for stakeholder review
- Design system with reusable components for development handoff

---

## Phase 5: Create Prototype

### Objective
Build an interactive prototype to simulate real user experience.

### Activities
- Link all screens with Figma or other prototyping tools to simulate app flow
- Demonstrate trip creation, matching, chat, community feed, nearby essentials, and SOS features
- Test AI interaction flows, notifications, and personalized recommendations
- Gather feedback from potential users or focus groups for usability improvements

### Deliverables
- Fully interactive prototype
- Feedback report and design iteration plan

---

## Phase 6: Create MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Objective
Develop a working product with core features to test market response.

### Activities

#### Backend Development
- Database setup, APIs, AI & SOS integrations

#### Frontend Development
- React Native / Flutter for mobile, or ReactJS for web dashboard

#### Core Features Implementation
- User onboarding & profile creation
- Trip creation & management
- Matching algorithm & AI-based suggestions
- Nearby essentials with map integration
- Community feed & engagement features
- Emergency SOS functionality

#### Testing
- Unit testing, functional testing, security & performance testing
- Deploy MVP to staging environment for internal testing

### Deliverables
- Fully functional MVP with essential features
- Test reports & bug logs
- Feedback collection for next iterations

---

## Next Phases (Post-MVP – Optional)

### 1. Beta Testing
Launch to limited audience for real-world testing.

### 2. Iteration & Improvement
Incorporate feedback, fix bugs, and optimize AI & UX.

### 3. Full Launch
Public release with marketing, monetization features, and analytics.

### 4. Continuous Enhancements
New AI features, sponsored integrations, and gamification updates.

## Timeline Estimation

| Phase | Duration | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Requirements | 2-3 weeks | Stakeholder availability |
| Phase 2: Design | 1-2 weeks | Phase 1 completion |
| Phase 3: Wireframes | 2-3 weeks | Phase 2 completion |
| Phase 4: High-Fidelity | 3-4 weeks | Phase 3 completion |
| Phase 5: Prototype | 2-3 weeks | Phase 4 completion |
| Phase 6: MVP | 8-12 weeks | Phase 5 completion |

**Total Estimated Timeline: 18-27 weeks (4.5-6.5 months)**

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1-5 (Pre-Development)
- Stakeholder approval on requirements
- User testing feedback scores (>4/5)
- Design system completeness (100% components)

### Phase 6 (MVP)
- User registration rate
- Trip creation completion rate
- Matching success rate
- User retention (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)
- SOS feature reliability (99.9% uptime)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **AI/ML Integration**: Start with simple algorithms, iterate
- **Real-time Features**: Use proven technologies (Socket.io, WebRTC)
- **Scalability**: Design with microservices architecture

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Extensive user testing and feedback loops
- **Safety Concerns**: Robust verification and reporting systems
- **Competition**: Focus on unique AI and safety features

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Strict MVP feature prioritization
- **Resource Constraints**: Agile development with regular checkpoints
